# Group-Chat-Rooms (Live : https://group-chat-room-ab.herokuapp.com/)

<h4>The heroku link is not working because heroku has removed its free tier.</h4>

This is a server rendered single chat room which is similar to a single whatsapp group. 
The backend is built using Node js and express js. I have used socket.io to implement real time data transfer (both messages as well as files).
You can send messages as well as any type of files.
